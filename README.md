### twld

`twld` is an ocaml library for querying and editing a terraria world file. 

The goal is to make it easy write programs that interact with Terraria's world
file format. 

Most of the code for this project will be carried over and extended from my
earlier projects with Terraria's world files. Eventually, those projects should
adopt this library and become much simpler as a result.
